<strong>Frogger takes place with a frog, who works to navigate across moving cars, logs, and turtles! 
<br />The player wins if they can reach the end of the level, without getting hit 3 times!</strong>
<br /> <br />
To play my Frogger game, Greenfoot must be installed (Can install Greenfoot here: https://www.greenfoot.org/download). 
Then, clone the repository and open the project.greenfoot file! Press the Run button in the Greenfoot interface and enjoy!
